## Overview
Where's Walter was created out of the need for a central platform allowing pet owners to post their lost pet notices, allowing for more accessibilty and a wider outreach to 
help bring their family members home. The intention is for users to create or update their own lost or found pet notices, browse those created by other members, and connect, message, 
and follow other members or notice updates.

## Context
I am a front-end developer, having recently graduated from the Turing School of Software and Design, and a passionate advocate for animal rights and welfare. This program was concieved with 
the intention of performing a much-needed function while providing me an avenue to learn React Native and Ruby on Rails.
