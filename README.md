## Overview
Where's Walter was created out of the need for a centralized platform where lost and found pet notices may be posted and viewed. The intention is for users to create or update their own notices, browse those created by other members (filterable either by location or pet description), and connect, message, and follow other members or notice updates allowing for a more accessible and centralized information hub, a wider reach, and easier communication and connection-- all in service of finding and bringing lost family members back home.

## Context
I am a front-end developer, having recently graduated from the Turing School of Software and Design, and a passionate advocate for animal rights and welfare. This program was concieved with 
the intention of performing a much-needed function while providing me an avenue to learn React Native and Ruby on Rails.
